#  Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

PyBer is in need of a better understanding the weekly fares by the different city types PyBer operates in.  These would be Rural, Suburban and Urban.  This analysis will assist the president of the company in better understanding the fares by these differeing regions.  Specifically with the intent of identifying areas where any disperate treatment of drivers and riders can be addressed.   Finally it's important to diliver not only the infomratioon, but also a graphical representation of our findings to assist in the ease of understanding the data and gain insight into steps to address any issues.

#  Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The primary rideshare difference amoung the three city types is that we see a substantially higher volume of riders in the Urban locations.  Total fares in urban areas often result in more than $2,000 dollars a week, as compared to suburban average weekly fares of roughly $1,000.  Both of which are considerabily higher than fares for the Rural areas at an average of $250 a week.

Not only do the average fare volumes differ by week, but so do the average rides per week.  Over this time period, we see total rides in urban areas have much higher ride volumes, offsetting the fact that the average fare per ride is slightly less than Suburban and Rural areas.  Rural areas on the other hand see a very low total rides, but with a slightly higher average fare.  Suburban landing both in the middle of the pack with ride volume and average fare.

See the image below including the details of the findings.

#  Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

The three recommendations I would make to address the disparities among the city types would be these:

  1.  Given that rural areas typically more sparsly populated I would work to decrease the average fares in these areas.  It's likely that each individual using PyBer in rural areas needs to travel further for services.  This often cost more money, and can be a difficult choice to make, as rural areas are often not as enomonically properous.  Additionally for rural areas, I would campaign to increase available drivers.  Possibly offer additional mileage subsidies for urban drivers to assist in rural areas, as many urban drivers are not utilzied on a regular basis.

2.  For Suburban areas, we see a good mix of drivers to fares, as well as a moderate fare price for rides.  Though the suburban market appears to be functioning quite well, there's always room for growth.  We do see a slight driver shortage in the suburban market, indiciating that we may benefit from expanding our driver base.  Again, like the rural market, we may be able to encourage additioanl support for drivers in the urban markets by allowing these drivers to support the suburban market when ride demand is low in urban areas.

3.  Finally, the urban market.  This market has signficantly lower average fares.  This is likely due to the condensed nature of the neighborhoods.  Due to this riders are getting a low price for the ride.  Additionally, the riders are benefiting from a surplus of drivers.   From the driver side of things, it should be known that we have only provide a paying customer to roughly 67% of our drivers.   This can be remedied if we offered the drivers incentives to support the suburban and especially the rural markets.  This would be likely chance a driver could be compensated with a fare to nearly %80.  Additionally, the average fare is higher in these areas, and may be the only incentive needed to motivate drivers to assist in demand heavy markets.  Lastly, if we increase the drivers in the demand heavy markets the average fares will increase, and add to overall company revenue as well.  The best time to try this would be around mid March to early April as ridership increases for rural markets at this time.
